# Chall-IOT-Locker-Android-Client

This IOT Locker has been built for a Cyber-Security challenge.
It is not designed for production purpose because it contains several vulnerabilities. 

This repository contains the source code of the Android application. 
The physical construction plans of the Vault and the Python server code running on the embedded Raspberry Pi will be shared later.
